# Sprite Editor

You can run the sprite editor with the following command:
```bash
go run github.com/dfirebaugh/tortuga/cmd/spritely
```

At the moment, the encoded string of what's on the canvas will be output to the console.
You can also save the entire animation to a file by pressing ctrl+s.


To open an existing sprite/animation, run the following command:

```bash
go run github.com/dfirebaugh/tortuga/cmd/spritely -sprite ./examples/platformer/assets/heart.spr
```
