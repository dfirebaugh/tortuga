# Tortuga
> note: this project is a work in progress and in early stages

The goal of tortuga is to be able to easily make tiny games.
Tortuga is similar to [turtle](https://github.com/dfirebaugh/turtle). However, several components have been stripped out (e.g. the lua interpretter, the web editor, etc...).

I'd like to focus on more core components of the game engine before building out the flashy stuff.

The structure of tortuga mimics that of a physical game console.
